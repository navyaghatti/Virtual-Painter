The Virtual Painter is a computer vision project that allows users to draw on the screen in real-time using hand gestures, without any physical tools. 
Leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, the application enables users to select colors, and create drawings simply by moving their hands in front of the webcam.
